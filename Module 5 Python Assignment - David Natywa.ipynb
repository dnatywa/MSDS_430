    "<font color=green> One aspect of data science is working with data from files. In this assignment we will learn to read in a text file and extract some useful information. In addition to extracting information from an existing file, we will be creating a text file, appending to that file, and performing some calculations with the data. Later in the course we'll learn more about how to display this information neatly and manipulate the data more efficiently, but for now we start by learning the basics of reading and writing text files.  </font>"
