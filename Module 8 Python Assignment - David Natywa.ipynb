    "<font color=green> Python comes with many useful modules that have already been created. However, it's not uncommon to need to create some of your own for a specific use. In this assignment we begin looking at defining methods that might be useful for a class object. Attaching methods to a class is a convenient way to carry out certain operations or perform tasks. As extra practice, it's recommended that you try to create your own class that you might find useful in your career or for something that interests you. </font>"

    "Problem 2 (10 pts.): The equation of a line is given by `y = mx + b`. The coefficient `m` describes the slope or steepness of the line and is calculated by taking the difference of the y-values of two points divided by the difference of the x-values. For example, the slope of the line passing through the two points `(4, 11)` and `(6, 15)` is `(15 - 11)/(6 - 4) = 4/2 = 2`. The coefficient `b` is where the line crosses the y-axis and is determined by using either point in the equation `y = mx + b` and solving for `b`. For example, using the point `(4, 11)` and `m = 2`, we have `11 = 2(4) + b` so `b = 3`.\n",
