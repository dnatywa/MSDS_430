    "<font color=green> In this module we're continuing our look at classes and objects. Our goal is to gain more practice with classes and objects to fit into the theme of extensibility. The more we can reuse our code, the more valuable it is. In last week's assignment we added methods to class that was already defined for us. For this assignment, we'll be creating our own. Just as with last week's assignment, you're encouraged to think about how classes might play a role in your industry and begin thinking about ones you might create for your own use. </font>"
